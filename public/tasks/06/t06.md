# Task 06: The Singular Anomaly

Out of the endless flood of data pulled from my network, countless words and numbers clash in chaos. Yet, there’s one word that stands apart—a lone signal in the noise that holds the key to our next move.

Your mission:
1. **Tame the Data Flood:**
   Dive into the massive dataset and find that one unique word hiding in plain sight.

2. **Isolate the Signal:**
   Use word counting tools (think `wc`) to filter out the clutter and extract the single word that dares to be different.

3. **Write Your Code:**
   Develop a script that:
   - Processes the dataset.
   - Identifies and extracts the unique word.
   - Outputs this crucial clue to the screen.

4. **Lock It Down:**
   Save your work as `script.sh`.

Let that standout word be the spark that lights our way. Dive deep into the data and extract the one word that stands apart. This singular word is the final key—it reveals the location of my hidden lair and confirms your triumph.
