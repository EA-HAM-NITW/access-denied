# Task 06: The Singular Anomaly

Amidst a deluge of data—a cacophony of words and numbers—one word emerges as a lone beacon. It is an anomaly that defies the overwhelming uniformity, a unique key hidden in plain sight.

Your mission:

1. **Harness the Data Tidal Wave:**  
   Within the vast dataset provided, countless words vie for attention. Yet, only one word stands apart from all the rest.

2. **Uncover the Unique Signature:**  
   Employ word counting techniques (think along the lines of the `wc` command) to sift through the noise. Your task is to isolate this solitary, unique word that holds the key to the next phase of your quest.

3. **Craft Your Incantation:**  
   Write a script that processes the dataset, identifies the singular outlier, and extracts its mystery. This script should be saved in a file called `script.sh`.

Let the sound of the data reveal its secret. Trust your analytical prowess to unearth that one word—not lost in a sea of repetition, but brilliantly unique. The truth lies in its isolation.
