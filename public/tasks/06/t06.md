# Task 06: The Singular Anomaly

Amidst a sprawling deluge of data extracted from Phantom's network, countless words and figures clash in chaotic disarray. Yet, within this cacophony, one word stands alone—a singular anomaly that defies the overwhelming uniformity.

Your mission:
1. **Harness the Data Tidal Wave:**  
   Within the vast dataset provided, innumerable words compete for attention. But only one word shines as a beacon of uniqueness.

2. **Uncover the Unique Signature:**  
   Use word counting techniques (imagine employing the `wc` command) to filter through the noise and isolate this solitary, distinctive word that holds the key to the next chapter of our hack.

3. **Craft Your Incantation:**  
   Develop a script that:
   - Processes the dataset.
   - Identifies and extracts the unique word.
   - Outputs this extraordinary key to our investigation.

4. **Seal Your Work:**  
   Save your carefully crafted script in a file named `script.sh`.

Let this singular anomaly be the spark that ignites our complete understanding of Phantom’s secrets. With the words of the data, we will forge a path to victory.
