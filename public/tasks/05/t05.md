# Task 05: The Whispered Transformation

Here's your next move: Among those hidden text files from before, one holds a secret environment variable. This isn't just any variable—it’s the key that needs to be set to **MONEY** to push your mission forward. Dig in, find it, and let that value unlock the next layer of my plan.

Your mission:

1. **Recall the Hidden Name:**  
   The answer from Task 02 is the key—it is the very name of the environment variable waiting to be activated.

2. **Command the Transformation:**  
   Craft a script that resets this environment variable to the new value **MONEY** and print it out. This recalibration is essential to altering Phantom’s system configuration.
