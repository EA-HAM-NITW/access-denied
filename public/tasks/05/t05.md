# Task 05: The Whispered Transformation

In the hushed corridors of Phantom’s digital domain, we discovered a dormant environment variable—its name is none other than the secret you unearthed in Task 02. Our intelligence now mandates a transformation: this variable must be set to **MONEY**.

Your mission:
1. **Recall the Hidden Name:**  
   The answer from Task 02 is the key—it is the very name of the environment variable waiting to be activated.

2. **Command the Transformation:**  
   Craft a script that resets this environment variable to the new value **MONEY**. This recalibration is essential to altering Phantom’s system configuration.

3. **Seal Your Work:**  
   Save your script in a file named `script.sh`. Your incantation must execute flawlessly, ensuring that the variable is updated each time it runs.

Let this transformation be the turning point in our pursuit of Phantom. Change his environment, and change his destiny.
