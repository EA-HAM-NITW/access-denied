# Task 05: The Whispered Transformation

In the hushed corridors of your system, rumors persist of a mystical environment variable—its name is none other than the secret you unearthed in Task 02. The ancient script now calls for a change: this variable must be transformed to hold the value **MONEY**.

Your mission:

1. **Recall the Hidden Name:**  
   The answer you discovered in Task 02 is not just a clue—it is the name of the environment variable that lies dormant, waiting to be awakened.

2. **Command the Transformation:**  
   Craft a script that sets this environment variable to **MONEY**. This change is your key to unlocking further secrets.

3. **Seal Your Work:**  
   Save your script in a file named `script.sh`. Your incantation must reliably perform the transformation when executed.

Trust in the whispers of the digital void. Let your script serve as the ritual that transforms subtle hints into tangible power, and may the value **MONEY** be its decree.
