# Task 01: The Hidden Coordinates of Phantom

In the chaotic sea of coded pincodes lies a secret map—one that Phantom used to evade capture. His sly trail hides a 6-digit key that pinpoints the location of a critical fragment of his stolen plans.

Your mission:
- Venture into the labyrinth of data using your team ID as your beacon.
- Use tools like `grep` or `awk` to sift through the chaos and extract the hidden coordinates.
- Note that while the first four digits are always **1100**, the final two hold the secret you'll need to decode phantom’s route.

Every number tells a tale of devious escape routes across India. Decipher the pattern, extract the truth, and chart the coordinates that lead to Phantom’s lair.

## Expected output:

```
17.52069444 78.44466667
```

```
17.1522222 79.8691944
```
