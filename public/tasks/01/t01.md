# Task 01

In the mess of pincodes lies a secret - a hidden 6-digit key that marks a crucial piece of Phantom's treasure. Here's what you need to do:

1. Venture into the labyrinth of the data using your team ID as your beacon
2. Use tools like `grep` or `awk` to read through the data and get the latitude and longitude of the secret location (Hint: It's the first occurrence)
3. Note that the first four digits are always **1100**, the final two digits are held as the secret which you'll need to figure out.
4. Save your final answer in `script.sh` file and run `check` command

## Expected output format

```
17.52069444 78.44466667
```

```
17.1522222 79.8691944
```
