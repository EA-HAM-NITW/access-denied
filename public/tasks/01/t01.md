# Task 01: The Hidden Coordinates of Phantom

In the mess of coded pincodes lies my secret map—the very map I used to vanish. I've hidden a 6-digit key that marks a crucial piece of my treasure. Here's what you need to do:

Your mission:

- Venture into the labyrinth of data using your team ID as your beacon.
- Use tools like `grep` or `awk` to sift through the chaos and extract the hidden coordinates.
- Note that while the first four digits are always **1100**, the final two hold the secret you'll need to decode phantom’s route.

Every number is a clue to my moves across India. Figure out the pattern, get the truth, and mark the spot that leads straight to my lair.

## Phantom's Expected Protocol:

```
17.52069444 78.44466667
```

```
17.1522222 79.8691944
