# Task 01: The Hidden Coordinates of Phantom

In the mess of coded pincodes lies my secret mapâ€”the very map I used to vanish. I've hidden a 6-digit key that marks a crucial piece of my treasure. Here's what you need to do:

- Use your team ID to dive into the data.
- Use tools like grep or awk to sift through the clutter and pull out the hidden coordinates.
- Remember, the first four digits are always 1100; the last two are the secret to my escape route.

Every number is a clue to my moves across India. Figure out the pattern, get the truth, and mark the spot that leads straight to my lair.

## Phantom's Expected Protocol:

```
17.52069444 78.44466667
```

```
17.1522222 79.8691944
```
