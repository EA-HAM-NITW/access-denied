# Task 01: The Hidden Coordinates

In the chaotic sea of pincodes lies a secret—a 6-digit code that guards the location of a critical fragment of the map.  
 
Your mission:
- Explore the chaos with precision, the clue is to use your team ID
- Use either `grep` or `awk` to sift through the clutter.
- Discover the hidden coordinates that will lead you further into this maze.
- The first four digits of the secret code is 1100, the next two is left for you to figure out 


Every number has a story, and this one in particular points to a precise latitude and longitude. The key is concealed within the digits—decipher the pattern, extract the truth, and reveal the secret that lies beneath.

## Expected output:

```
17.52069444 78.44466667
```

```
17.1522222 79.8691944
