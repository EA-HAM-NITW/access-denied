# Task 04: The Enigmatic Files in the Shadows

Deep within the secret confines of your "files" folder, a collection of hidden `.txt` files awaits discovery. These files, cloaked by a veil of invisibility (their names begin with a dot), follow a mysterious naming conventionâ€”a pattern that echoes the answer from Clue 2.

Your mission is twofold:

1. **Decipher the Hidden Pattern:**  
   Venture into the "files" folder and search for all hidden `.txt` files. Their filenames are not random; they all start with the exact sequence that you uncovered in Clue 2. Your challenge is to identify this regex pattern that marks the true files amongst the clutter.

2. **Script the Revelation:**  
   Craft a script that will:
   - Traverse the "files" folder within your home directory.
   - Use regular expressions to filter and list only those `.txt` files whose names begin with your Clue 2 answer.
   - Output the names of these files to reveal the hidden trail.

3. **Seal Your Work:**  
   Save your script in a file named `script.sh`.

The secrets of the "files" folder are waiting to be unearthed. Trust your instincts, master the regex incantation, and let your script unveil the true identities hidden in the shadows.
