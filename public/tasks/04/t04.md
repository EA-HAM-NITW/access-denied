# Task 04: The Enigmatic Files in the Shadows

In the dim recesses of the "files" folder on Phantom’s hacked machine, a series of hidden `.txt` files lie in wait. These files, obscured by a leading dot, follow a mysterious naming convention—a pattern echoing the answer from Clue 2.

Your mission is twofold:
1. **Decipher the Hidden Pattern:**  
   Explore the "files" folder and search for all hidden `.txt` files. Their names adhere to a secret regex pattern that starts with the precise sequence you discovered in Clue 2. Identify this pattern to reveal Phantom’s signature.

2. **Script the Revelation:**  
   Create a script that:
   - Traverses the "files" folder in your home directory.
   - Employs regular expressions to filter and list only those `.txt` files whose names begin with your Clue 2 answer.
   - Outputs the names of these files, exposing the hidden trail.

3. **Seal Your Work:**  
   Save your script in a file named `script.sh`.

Let the encrypted naming convention expose the underbelly of Phantom’s operations. Use your keen eye and regex mastery to light the way through the shadows.
