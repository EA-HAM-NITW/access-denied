# Task 03: The Vault's Secret Transformation

Deep in a forgotten digital vault on Phantom’s machine, a collection of files hides critical fragments of his stolen data. These files, stored in the `files/` directory, wear deceptive extensions that mask their true purpose.

A mysterious order has been received from our infiltration team: to unlock the vault’s secrets, you must change these misleading extensions to match a secret code known only to the initiated.

Your mission:
1. **Uncover the Hidden Order:**  
   Inspect the `files/` folder where every file conceals a clue to Phantom’s plans. Their current extensions, however, serve as an impenetrable barrier.

2. **Invoke the Transformation Ritual:**  
   Write a script that navigates the `files/` directory and renames each file by changing its extension to align with the secret code required to breach the vault.

3. **Seal Your Work:**  
   Save your script in a file named `script.sh`. Your script should:
   - Locate all files (recursively) within `files/`.
   - Rename them to adopt the new hidden extension.

Your actions will unmask the stolen secrets hidden behind these deceptive files. Proceed with caution, as Phantom’s shadow looms large.
