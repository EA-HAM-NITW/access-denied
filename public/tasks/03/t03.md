# Task 03

Deep in Phantom's digital vault lies a trove of files hinding pieces of my stolen data. They are present in the `files/` directory, but their file extensions are problematic. Your mission:

1. List all the files under `files/` directory
2. Replace the files extensions with a secret code (You've encountered it earlier in the previous stage)
3. Print the output in the expected format

## Expected output format

```
a4c9.phan bfn5.phan i3sd.phan
```
