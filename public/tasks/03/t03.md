# Task 03: The Vault's Secret Transformation

Deep in my digital vault lies a trove of files hiding pieces of my stolen data. They're in the `files/` directory, but their file extensions are a ruse—meant to hide their true purpose.

Your mission:
1. **Uncover the Clues:**
   Check out the `files/` folder. Each file holds a hint to my plans, but the wrong extension blocks your view.

2. **Change the Code:**
   Write a script that digs through the `files/` directory (and all its subdirectories) and renames each file. Change its extension to the secret code that unlocks the vault.

3. **Lock It Down:**
   Save your script as `script.sh`. Your script must:
   - Find all files recursively inside `files/`.
   - Rename them to use the new hidden extension.

Follow these steps to reveal my secrets. Stay sharp—the shadows are watching.
