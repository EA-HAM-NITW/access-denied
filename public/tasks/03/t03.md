# Task 03: The Vault's Secret Transformation

In the heart of a forgotten vault, a cryptic archive lies hidden—a collection of files whose names alone cannot reveal their true purpose. For years, these files have been stored in the `files/` directory with misleading extensions, obscuring the critical messages they contain.

A mysterious order has been whispered through the corridors of power: in order to unlock the vault's secrets, you must invoke a transformation. The files must be renamed so that their extensions match a secret code—a hidden extension that has been hinted at in earlier legends.

Your mission is as follows:

1. **Uncover the Hidden Order:**  
   Within the `files/` directory, every file holds clues to the vault’s mysteries. Their current extensions, however, stand in the way of revelation.

2. **Invoke the Transformation Ritual:**  
   Craft a script that delves into the `files/` directory and renames every file. Change each file’s extension so that it aligns with the secret code required to unlock the vault's secrets.

3. **Seal Your Work:**  
   Save your script in a file named `script.sh`. Your script should:
   - Recursively locate all files within `files/`.
   - Rename each file to adopt the new hidden extension.

Keep your senses sharp and your commands precise. The transformation is vital—a single misstep could leave the vault’s secrets forever shrouded in darkness. Let the silent echoes of the past guide your hands, and may your script unmask the true identity hidden behind those deceptive files.
