# Task 02: The Postal Cipher

Deep within the underbelly of India's urban sprawl, whispers circulate of Phantom’s secret postal network. Certain landmarks have been tampered with, leaving behind a series of cryptic office names:

- Janta Market S.O
- Rajouri Garden J 6 S.O
- Rajouri Market S.O
- Tagore Garden S.O
- Subhash Nagar West S.O
- Subhash Nagar S.O (West Delhi)

Legends hint that these exact names hide a numeric enigma—a mysterious pincode that Phantom used to coordinate his stealthy moves. Your twofold objective is:

1. **Decipher the Connection:**  
   Use text-search techniques (think `grep` or `awk`) against the dataset to connect these precise names. The result will unveil the elusive pincode.

2. **Extract the Hidden Identifier:**  
   With the pincode in hand, probe the provided HTML file. Within its code, locate the `<div>` tag that contains this number. That tag hides an `id` attribute—the final key to Phantom’s secrets.

Create a script named `script.sh` that:
- Searches the HTML file for the `<div>` containing the pincode.
- Extracts and prints its `id` attribute.

Embark on this mission as nothing is as it seems. Every clue in this urban maze brings us one step closer to unveiling Phantom’s covert operations.
