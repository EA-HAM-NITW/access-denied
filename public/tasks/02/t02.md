# Task 02: The Postal Cipher

Deep in the underbelly of the city, whispers circulate about a secret that ties together a series of landmarks. A strange fate seems to have intertwined the following places:

- Janta Market S.O
- Rajouri Garden J 6 S.O
- Rajouri Market S.O
- Tagore Garden S.O
- Subhash Nagar West S.O
- Subhash Nagar S.O (West Delhi)

Legends hint that these names, when examined carefully, hide a numeric secret—a mysterious pincode that you must uncover. Your objective is twofold:

1. **Decipher the Connection:**  
   Using text-search techniques (think `grep` or `awk`), hunt for these exact names in the dataset. Follow the breadcrumbs they leave behind to unveil the hidden pincode.  
   
2. **Extract the Hidden Identifier:**  
   Once you have deduced the pincode, scour the provided HTML file. Within its code, locate a `<div>` tag that contains this number. That `<div>` tag holds an `id` attribute—the final key.  
   
   To complete your quest, write a script named `script.sh` that:
   - Searches the HTML file for the `<div>` tag with the secret pincode.
   - Extracts and prints the `id` attribute associated with that tag.

The trail is subtle and the puzzle, intricate. Let each carefully chosen name guide your investigation as you piece together the clues. Trust your intuition, construct your script, and reveal the deeper secret hidden behind the urban façade.
